Things your little one couldn't reach when crawling and pulling up may now be accessible to a toddler who can walk and eventually climb. Be conscious of where your toddler could pull something over or get caught and trip. Block the stairs - top and bottom. And remember never leave your toddler unattended." TextColor="Black"/>
