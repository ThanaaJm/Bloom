Your baby's age and development will define how to serve these foods. For a baby just starting out with solids, the bigger the better (think big broccoli florets or a stick of banana). At around nine-m old, you can start to break or cut foods up into smaller pieces. This allows your baby to start using their pincer grasp to pick food up. "
