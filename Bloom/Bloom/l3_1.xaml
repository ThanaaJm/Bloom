                <Label Text="The continuous movement of a ball will hold your baby's attention. Playing with them will help to build balance and coordination. But balls also allow babies to learn about cause and effect. If I roll this away from me what happens? If I roll it down this slope what happens? If I try to roll it back up, what happens?"

                <Label Text="Spend some time outside rolling a ball back and forth. This may seem a tad boring and repetitive to you, but repetition is how babies learn. Judith Wright, a literacy specialist with the Ontario Early Years Centres in London says, A baby needs 1,000 repetitions to learn a word; by the time they are a toddler, they might need 50 repetitions; and when they are in kindergarten, they may need only a few repetitions to master it because the brain connections have been laid out. Repetitive play works in just the same way." TextColor="Black"/>

                <Label Text="Choose balls in a variety of sizes for different skill development - it takes a different skill set to throw two-handed as opposed to the one-handed throw with a smaller ball. Add balls of different textures and firmness making sure they are not too heavy). Keep some balls on-hand that can be used indoors too." TextColor="Black"/>
                <Label Text="As your baby grows, they will learn that palls go beyond just rolling. They willearr to drop, roll, bounce, toss and kick a ball. Their hand-eye coordination (or foot-eye coordination) will improve over time. Before you know it, they will be throwing the ball and chasing after it." TextColor="Black"/>
