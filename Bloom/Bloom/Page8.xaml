                <Label  Padding="10" Text=" Some parents are concerned about the amount baby spits up when burped. Most of the time spitting up simply means your baby has eaten more than his stomach can handle, or maybe some of the milk is above an air bubble that is released with burping. Keep in mind it's not all milk that's being spit up -it's mixed with mucous and saliva. So when a baby spits up, it doesn't necessarily mean he's losing all he's eaten. "

                <Label  Padding="10" Text="Most of the time spitting up is a laundry problem rather than a health problem. If, however, your baby exhibits any of the following signs, you may want to discuss spitting with your baby's healthcare provider: vomitina that is forceful and causes distress or discomfort for baby, any blood in the vomit or what looks like coffee grounds, bright green or yellow vomit, refusal to feed for more than two feedings in a row, lack of weight gain, and vomit accompanied by other signs of illness such as fever or difficulty breathing.
