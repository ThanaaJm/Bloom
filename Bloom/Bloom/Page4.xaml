            <Label  Padding="10" Text="The truth is, newborns can absolutely be all those things - and at various points in time they absolutely will be. But they will also be hard work.

And when you only have a handful of things you're good at, they each tend to get a fair amount of plav. Which means that for as many sweet cuddles as you get, there will also be plenty of tears to work through."

You were in a new world, surrounded by people who seemed to love and care for vou, but who didn't speak your language and couldn't always understand what you were thinking or feeling. Then imagine that you were completely reliant upon those people to fulfill your every need - incapable of feeding yourself, or doing much else for that matter. What would you do to express yourself whenever you had needs that weren't being met? "

You'll learn to pay attention to vour schedule and to know that if a certain number of hours have passed since your little one last ate -hunger is probably the source of those tears. Similarly, you'll learn to check the diaper first when crying begins. You'll pick up on those cues, and before you know it, your baby will be using those tears to communicate with you. "

Particularly in the first 4 months of life, there will occasionally be periods of crying that don't seem to have a solution. That's because. they don't. Sometimes babies just cry. Just like you sometimes have bad days, your baby may experience times of increased sensitivity or sadness. He might also be gassy, or teething. or just plain not feeling well. And other times, they may iust want to cry. "

            <Label  Padding="10" Text="However, if your baby is crying more than usual, or if his cry is high-pitched, contact your doctor. You know your baby's pattern better than anyone else, so if you notice anything unusual like a weak cry or moan, a different pattern of crying, or if it looks as if your baby is in pain, don't hesitate to contact your doctor. A sudden shrill cry followed by a brief silence and then more crying may also indicate pain "
