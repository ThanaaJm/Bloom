Better scoop it up with your fingernail and give it a smell to find out.) And some have to do with the crazy places your mind now goes.  "

But now that you're a parent, you know the truth: your brain is fully capable of going places you wouldn't ever want it to go. And sometimes (maybe even a lot of times) you will have flashes of all the terrible things that could happen to your baby, and you will immediately want to break down in tears and scrub the thought away.
