The best way to find out whether the temperature is right is to feel it with your wrist rather than your hand. Your hand is much more used to temperature changes and you might think the water is too cool when in fact it's just right. Prepare a (warm) towel close by that you can put your baby in once you take her out of the tub. Right after taking a bath babies like to feed. You can wrap a dry towel around your baby after drying off and then feed right away with skin-to-skin contact."

PPD is still an illness that many don't talk about, but looking at the numbers we know it happens to a lot of new moms - and even dads! If you are feeling balanced, happy and just more tired than usual, great! If you are feeling blue, don't be ashamed. The important thing is to talk to someone about it. If you notice that your partner is not the same person anymore don't hesitate to talk to your healthcare provider."

                <Label Text="• Create rituals with your baby: Babies love rituals since it makes them feel safe and helps in their development. The ritual could be to change your little one into a sleeping sack at night, sing a lullaby when changing her diaper, massage your baby every morning or a give her a baby bath every night. If Daddy (or your baby-rearing partner) always baths your baby, this brings an added layer of ritual. Encouraging your partner to be involved in this kind of activity helps pull them into the daily routine."/>
                <Label Margin="5" Text="• Sleep when your baby sleeps: Make sure you are still watching your sleep.
Take a nap during the day when your baby sleeps and keep the lights dimmed when you feed your baby at night. This will show your little one that there is nothing interesting going on and she can go right back to sleep after the feeding."/>
                <Label Margin="5" Text="• Use the 5 S's to calm down your baby:
Put your swaddled baby in your arms on its side against your belly while giving your finger to suckle on. Then you sway back and forth while shushing rhythmically in your baby's ear. After a few minutes your baby will calm down."/>
                <Label Margin="5" Text="• Treat yourself: What could help you regain your energy and body? Whether it's a yoga class, a walk in the park, a massage or good cup of coffee with a friend. Get out and do something for yourself or your relationship with your partner. Becoming parents is a big change and it's important to stay connected to each other and the outside world."/>

Try cradling your baby on her belly in your arms so your underarm is creating some pressure against the belly. Or you can try to massage your baby's belly gently clockwise around the navel. Moving the legs up and down can also help to relief gas. Or sit down with your legs closed and put your crying bundle of joy in your lap facing you. Your baby's legs push in your belly, you wrap your arms around your baby's body and your hands around your baby's head. Get very close and talk gently to your baby."/>

There are so many options and you may want to try a few with your baby to see which one she likes. The main question always is: Do I carry my baby in or out? The answer is: always carry your baby facing in. Here are 7 reasons to not carry your baby facing out:"
                   Margin="9"/>
                <Label Margin="5" Text="1. Babies like to nap. When a baby falls asleep on the parent while being carried on your chest, it will have the beneficial opportunity of sleeping with its head gently turned to one side or the other.
This will also allow for cuddle time.
Leaning against the parent also stimulates a huge amount of neurological integration and development for the baby."/>
                <Label Margin="5" Text="2. You might notice that when you pick up your baby, she will instinctively draw the legs into a squat/straddle position. The best position for your baby's legs in a carrier are when the knees are up above the developing hips and your baby is in a squatting posture. If you put your little one in an outward-facing-carrier, her legs dangle down. This is not only unsupportive of normal hip development, it may have negative effects."/>
                <Label Margin="5" Text="3. Your back will hurt when you have your baby face out. You will notice that you need to shift your hips in order to balance your little one with dangling legs out. The reason is that you put strain on your spine. In order to stay aligned make sure to turn your baby facing inward."/>
                <Label Margin="5" Text="4. If your baby faces outward you constantly need to hold your baby's legs up or the feet. Your baby will grasp your fingers because it's off-balance in this position and they have nothing to hold on to. At the same time your little one will lean it's pelvis back (while you shift your hips forward) for balance. This is unhealthy for hip development and adds stress to the spine and nervous system."/>
                <Label Margin="5" Text="5. Your baby wants to bond with you. If your little one faces outward there is no familiar face or filter. Your baby won't feel very safe because she can't see you. Facing outward deprives babies of their natural, innate need for security and communication."/>
                <Label Margin="5" Text="6. When your baby is facing inward it is easy for your baby to have a quick snack on your breast while you are out and about carrying. This is impossible for an outward-facing carrier."/>
                <Label Margin="5" Text="7. There will be too much pressure placed on your baby's spinal curves when facing outward. A newborn only has one curve in the spine, the second one will develop over the next years. Right now it's a c curve and during the next few months baby will first develop the curve in the head/neck area when starting to lift its head while lying down or starting to crawl. Next the lower back curve develops when your little one becomes stronger and crawls longer. If you carry your baby outward, the natural c curve is forced into a reversed position before it has gone through the normal developmental stages it needs."/>

Your little one has probably added 40-50% to her birth weight and is smiling at you when you enter the room. At this age, your baby's brain has grown by 5cm and is all brain, meaning that many of the nutrients you are feeding her are being used to create new brain cells, allowing her to continue learning new things at a very rapid rate. Your baby is starting to see colors and patterns. Your baby may also be experimenting more with her vocal chords and making new sounds."

Your baby may begin showing more interest in toys that have more complicated textures, patterns or colors.
Make sure you have plenty of interesting things for them to see, touch and feel. You might also try exposing them to different kinds of music and notice their reaction.
What is their favorite?"

When you carry your baby make sure to hold on tightly since your baby is really strong now and kicks against you. The head is still wobbly but you can do more tummy-time while watching your precious one which allows the neck muscles to grow even stronger. Soon you will notice that your baby will be able to move the head from left to right. Nearly all babies of this age will flail their arms and legs at people and objects that they want to play with. Reaching and grasping is right around the corner! With so many possibilities for movement, it is very important to never leave babies unattended in places that are not perfectly safe. Never leave a young baby on an adult bed, couch, or high surface. You won't believe how far they can move, even before they learn to roll or crawl."
