You'd like to breastfeed and that is wonderful news since breastfeeding is the healthiest choice for both you and your baby. The WHO and UNICEF recommend that infants are exclusivelv breastfed for the first 6 months of life, and continue to be breastfed with the addition of appropriate complementary foods until 2 years or older. In order to successfully breastfeed, it is important to start off on the right foot and not get discouraged if things are a bit difficult in the beginning. "

Have your baby skin-to-skin as much as possible so vou can get to know each other in this new way. Usually within the first hour your baby will start rooting for your nipple. Don't hesitate to ask for the help of your midwife, doula or nurse to help your baby latch on. In the beginning your little one might not suck right away or close their mouth around the nipple completely. Be patient, it will happen. Once your baby latches on correctly, you will feel a gentle tugging. "

Infants who suckle within the first 2 hours ingest significantly more milk on day four than those who did not. After that, both you and baby will be very sleepy and breastfeeding is less important. Rest and try to wake up and feeu Davy every Snours or so. Try to breastfeed at least 8 to 12 times within the first 24 hours after your baby's birth.

Before this, vour breast milk will contain colostrum, which is very important for the first days after the birth.

The symptoms you might have include very warm breasts, pain in the breasts, swelling, chills, and sometimes fever. If vour baby can't latch on well because vour breast is swollen, put some warm cloths on your breast before feeding. Massage the breast and squeeze out some milk so the breast is getting softer. After breastfeeding, you may cool down the breast with cooling pads "
